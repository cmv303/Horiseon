# Horiseon - Social Solutions for Social Change

## Description

Refactored code to make it more efficient by utilizing semantic html, adding alt text for accessibility standards, and deleting lines of code both in html and css when they presented no use-value. i.e. deleting "class" names when there was only 1 parent of its kind (only one header, only one aside, etc etc).

This refactoring was done to make the Horiseon landing page more accessible to viewers who have impaired vision through adding descriptive text to image tags, and making the code easier to follow to allow for quicker debugging down the line.

Learning to use semantic html cuts down on the potential to mis-code because of repeating generic divider sections <divs> and lessens the amount allocating to trouble-shooting small semantic and syntactical errors that could arise as a result. Making use of semantic html and hightening accessibility standards also has the added befenfit of helping the seo reach higher visibility on search engines.
